# Wildcard Project

For this project I decided to work more with filter/map/fold and a few other methods we only briefly touched on in class. I've decided to use this for my wildcard project given that I'll probably be using these methods a lot down the line so I think becoming familiar with them now is a good idea. I set up various functions designed to work with a database of books to extract certain information, build a new data structure containing only books that meet certain criterion, or some combination of the two.

Analysis: All of these algorithms should run in O(n) (or O(2n) time if they combine multiple map, reduce, etc. operations) time given that they require one complete pass through the list. I believe each of these should also only use a constant amount of extra memory in the case that we are building a new array.
